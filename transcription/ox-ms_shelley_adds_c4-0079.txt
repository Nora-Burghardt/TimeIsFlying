/And thus contented with a lot/
/Which others, who have suffered not,/
And thus although she absent were
(/Fancy/ Memory) gave me (/g/all) /other/ of her
/I *dare to*/
/? fate/
/? to/
That even fancy dares to claim.-
/And I *will happy*. =?=/
/Thus I *were happy*, if *this* name/
/Of happiness/
/*My saddest* thought/
/*Her presence*/
/Within her presence/
/Th? by her presence, meek & tame/
/The ? of my spirit/ /lay/
Her presence had made weak & tame
(/Desire* ? I /was// All passions, and) /thought /no more//
/Of pleasures lost/(/or ?/ I lived alone,)
In the time which (/was/is) our own
The past & future were forgot
As they (/would be I/ had) been, & would be, not.-
/But now I desired,- I dare not/
But soon, the gaurdian angel gone
The demon reassumed his throne
